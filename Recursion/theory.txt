Let us consider a problem that a programmer have to determine the sum of first n natural 
numbers, there are several ways of doing that but the simplest approach is simply add the numbers 
starting from 1 to n. So the function simply looks like,

approach 1

Simply adding one by one

f(n) = 1 + 2 + 3 +……..+ n

Approach 2

Recursive adding 

f(n) = 1        n=1

f(n) = n + f(n-1)    n>1
